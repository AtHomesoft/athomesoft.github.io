        To All My Amazing Customers,
    </p>
    <p>
        It is with great sadness that I must announce the closure of
        AtHomesoft and the discontinued support and maintenance of
        the Strive and MyStrive software.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Strive desktop application will continue to operate in
        an offline capacity for as long as it continues to work, but
        will no longer receive updates. I cannot guarantee its
        quality from this point forward, and most integrations like
        ProPay and InTouch will eventually stop working (and may
        have already stopped working).
    </p>
    <p>
        The MyStrive mobile web application will officially be
        shutdown October 2021, which means you will no longer be
        able to access your Strive information via the web after
        October.
    </p>
    <p>
        I want to thank all of my loyal customers. I truly
        appreciate each and every one of you.
    </p>
    <p>
